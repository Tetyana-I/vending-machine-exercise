# React Router Vending Machine Exercise
In this exercise the React Router is used to build a vending machine. The application consists:

* *VendingMachine* component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that we can get from the vending machine.
* Three different snack components (*Candy*, *Chips*, *Soda*), each one corresponding to a vending machine snack. By clicking on an item in the VendingMachine we can view one of the snacks. Clicking updates the URL and shows the snack that we've clicked on. From each snack component, we are able to go back to the main VendingMachine component.
* *NavBar* - component that contains a second copy of the links. This is a site-wide navigation bar. It shows up at the top of each page.
